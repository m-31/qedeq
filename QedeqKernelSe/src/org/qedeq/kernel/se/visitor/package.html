The visitor design pattern allows you to decouple the classes for the data structure and the
algorithms used upon them. A practical result of this separation is the ability to add new
operations to existing object structures without modifying those structures.

<p>
Originally the idea is to use a structure of element classes, each of which has an accept method
that takes a visitor object as an argument. The visitor is an interface that has different visit
methods for each element class. The <code>accept()</code> method of an element class calls back
the <code>visitEnter()</code> and <code>visitLeave</code> methods for its class.

<p>
Separate concrete visitor classes can then be written that perform some particular
operations. One of these visit methods of a concrete visitor can be thought of as methods
not of a single class, but rather methods of a pair of classes: the concrete visitor and the
particular element class. Thus the visitor pattern simulates double dispatch in a conventional
single-dispatch object-oriented language such as Java.

<p>
The visitor pattern also specifies how iteration occurs over the object structure. In the
simplest version, where each algorithm needs to iterate in the same way, the
<code>accept()</code> method for a container element, in addition to calling back the
<code>visitEnter()</code> method of the visitor, also passes the visitor object to the
<code>accept()</code> method of all its constituent child elements. At the end the method
<code>visitLeave</code> is called.

<p>
Here we also decouple the transverse mechanism from the elements to gain control over
the iteration over the object structure.
