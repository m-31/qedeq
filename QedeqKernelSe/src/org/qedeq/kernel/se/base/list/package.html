Descriptions of element list functions. An element is either a list or an atom.
<p>
Each list has an operator and contains a number of elements.
A list has a size and their elements can be accessed by their position.
An atom carries textual data, has no operator and no size in the previous sense.

Elements can represent formulas and terms.
