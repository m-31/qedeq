<h2>Future Development</h2>
  <p>
  Here are descriptions of the previous and next minor releases. Subversions are not listed. All these releases are characterised as &quot;unstable&quot; (debian like) and are only of interest for developers.
  </p>

  <table width="90%" cellspacing=2 cellpadding=4>
  <tr>
  <td>0.01&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<font color="#555555">brigand</font></td>
  <td>First XSD releases. XML could be parsed and value objects are created.
    Very simple generation of LaTeX files is possible. There are two QEDEQ modules: the project handbook and a mathematical example. Beside the XSD verification no checking is done. The LaTeX generation works directly on the value objects.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>0.02<br>&nbsp;<font color="#555555">moster</font></td>
  <td>Some elements of the BO (business object) layer exist. The script of axiomatic set theory includes at least most of the axioms. First attempts of a small LaTeX to QEDEQ XML converter.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>0.03<br>&nbsp;<font color="#555555">mongaga</font></td>
  <td>Formal checks for single formulas could be done ("is this formula well formed").</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>0.04<br>&nbsp;<font color="#555555">gaffsie</font></td>
  <td>QEDEQ modules and the referenced modules are loaded from the web. The formula checking incorporates also all required QEDEQ modules and handles external definitions. External predicate and function constants are resolved.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>0.05<br>&nbsp;<font color="#555555">toffle</font></td>
  <td>Simple formal proofs can be written down in QEDEQ syntax.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>0.06<br>&nbsp;<font color="#555555">misabel</font></td>
  <td>Simple formal proofs can be checked.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>0.07<br>&nbsp;<font color="#555555">joxter</font></td>
  <td>All needed formal proof methods for Axiomatic Set Theory can be written down in QEDEQ syntax.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>0.08<br>&nbsp;<font color="#555555">hodgkins</font></td>
  <td>All proof methods that can be expressed within the QEDEQ syntax can be checked.</td>
