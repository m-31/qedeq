<H2>User Interface</H2>

    <H3>File Menu</H3>

    <H4>Load from Web</H4>
    After providing the URL of an QEDEQ module it is loaded from the web or from the local file buffer, if it was already previously loaded.

    <H4>Load local File</H4>
    You have to specify the file path for the QEDEQ module to load.

    <H4>Load all from QEDEQ.org</H4>
    Loads all QEDEQ modules from QEDEQ.org so you have some modules to work with. Currently this should need not much time. These modules are also stored in the local file buffer. You can look under <b>Tools / Preferences</b> to find out the exact directory path.

    <H4>Remove module</H4>
    Unload selected QEDEQ modules. Also changes state of all dependent modules. The unloaded modules are still in the file buffer.

    <H4>Clear buffer</H4>
    Unloads all QEDEQ modules and deletes all files from the QEDEQ module file buffer.

    <H4>Exit</H4>
    Saves loading information for later retrieval and exits the application.



    <H3>Check Menu</H3>

    <H4>Check Well-Formedness</H4>
    Checks if all formulas are well formed in all selected QEDEQ modules. Necessary modules are checked recursively. So firstly all imported modules are checked. Furthermore the correct sequence of definitions is checked: an operator must be defined before it can be used. 

    <H4>Check Fully-Formally Proved</H4>
    Checks recursivly if every used proposition has a formal correct proof.
    </H4>

    <H3>Plugins Menu</H3>
    Plugins do various things with the selected QEDEQ modules. Programming a plugin is largely independent from the development of the main program suite.

    <H4>Plugin Preferences</H4>
    Here all plugin configurations can be done. These configurations are persisted in the application specific <b>org.qedeq.properties</b> file. This file is generated with default values if it doesn't exist at application start.


    <H4>Remove Plugin Results</H4>
    Remove all plugin errors and warnings from the <b>Error</b> pane for all selected QEDEQ modules. Useful if you want to test a QEDEQ module with different models.

    <H4>Show module as UTF-8 text</H4>
    Show all selected modules within a text window. Takes loaded QEDEQ module and transforms it into UTF-8 text. The visual impression is unsurprisingly not as good as the DVI or PDF files. There might be some (or many) artefacts from unsupported structures. At least the line length is configurable.

    <H4>Create LaTeX</H4>
    Generates LaTeX output for all selected modules. These files can be transformed into PDF files. You can configure the debug output of reference labels.

    <H4>Create UTF-8</H4>
    Generates UTF-8 text files for all selected modules. See above for the output quality.

    <H4>Model Tester</H4>
    Takes the configured model and tests all axioms, definitions and propositions for model validity. Although the models are finite we do not guarantee for testing all variations. Especially predicate and function variables with large parameter numbers are not supported. But
this plugin already found some typos in our set theory script. Long running model tests can be stopped by using "Tools / Threads".

    <H3>Tools Menu</H3>

    <H4>LaTeX to QEDEQ</H4>
    Transforms LaTeX formulas into QEDEQ formulas. Predefined operators can be configured by editing the file named by the menu entry "Help / About" of the new window. Might be of interest for module authors.

    <H4>Preferences</H4>
    Here the non plugin preferences can be configured. 

    <H4>View Processes</H4>
    Opens an overview window that shows all service processes. You can also see the the module the plugin is working on. Running processes can be stopped. If the application runs under Java 1.5 (or higher) you can ask for a stack trace. Already finished processes can also shown if the data is still available. A service process can involve several plugin calls. These calls are listed if you press "Details".

    <H3>Help</H3>

    <H4>Help Contents</H4>
    Opens help window.

    <H4>About</H4>
    Tells about the running application and its environment. Here you can copy the java system properties into the clipboard.
