 	This is an unstable development release of <b>Hilbert II</b>.
 	In the tradition of Hilbert's program the project creates a
 	formal correct (checkable by a proof verifier) but readable
 	(like an ordinary LaTeX textbook) mathematical knowledge base
 	which is freely accessible within the internet. The project
 	started with logic and set theory.

    <p>
    This release contains a program suite that can produce LaTeX
    and UTF-8 files out of QEDEQ XML files. The QEDEQ files can
    be checked for syntactic correctness.
    For set theory we provide some small finite models. Checks for
    model validity are also included.
