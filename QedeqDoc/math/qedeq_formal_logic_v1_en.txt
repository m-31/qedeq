Summary
═══════

In this text we present the development of predicate calculus in axiomatic form.
The language of our calculus bases on the formalizations of  D .  H i l b e r t 
,  W .  A c k e r m a n n [hilback],  P .  S .  N o v i k o v [novikov], 
 V .  D e t l o v s  and  K .  P o d n i e k s [detnieks]. New rules can be 
derived from the herein presented logical axioms and basic inference rules. Only
these meta rules lead to a smooth flowing logical argumentation. For background 
informations see under  https://dspace.lu.lv/dspace/handle/7/1308  [detnieks] 
and  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_calculus .

Language
════════

In this chapter we define a formal language to express mathematical propositions
in a very precise way. Although this document describes a very formal approach 
to express mathematical content it is not sufficent to serve as a definition for
an computer readable document format. Therefore such an extensive specification 
has to be done elsewhere. Here our choosen format is the  E x t e n s i b l e  
 M a r k u p   L a n g u a g e  abbreviated  X M L . XML is a set of rules for 
encoding documents electronically.
          ┌
          │ See  http://www.w3.org/XML/  for more information.
          └
 The according formal syntax specification can be found at 
 http://www.qedeq.org/current/xml/qedeq.xsd . It specifies a complete 
mathematical document format that enables the generation of LaTeX books and 
makes automatic proof checking possible. Further syntax restrictions and some 
explanations can be found at 
 http://www.qedeq.org/current/doc/project/qedeq_logic_language_en.pdf .

Even this document is (or was generated) from an XML file that can be found 
here:  http://wwww.qedeq.org/0_04_07/doc/math/qedeq_logic_v1.xml . But now we 
just follow the traditional mathematical way to present the elements of 
mathematical logic.


1.1 Terms and Formulas
――――――――――――――――――――――

We use the  l o g i c a l   s y m b o l s  L = { ‘¬’, ‘∧’, ‘∨’, ‘↔’, ‘→’, ‘∀’, ‘
∃’ }, the  p r e d i c a t e   c o n s t a n t s  C = {c^k_i | i, k ∈ ω}, the 
 f u n c t i o n   v a r i a b l e s 
          ┌
          │ Function variables are used for a shorter notation. For example 
          │ writing an identity proposition x = y → f(x) = f(y). Also this 
          │ introduction prepares for the syntax extension for functional 
          │ classes.
          └
 F = {f^k_i | i, k ∈ ω ∧ k > 0}, the  f u n c t i o n   c o n s t a n t s 
          ┌
          │ Function constants are also introduced for convenience and are used 
          │ for direct defined class functions. For example to define building 
          │ of the power class operator, the union and intersection operator and
          │ the successor function. All these function constants can be 
          │ interpreted as abbreviations.
          └
 H = {h^k_i | i, k ∈ ω}, the  s u b j e c t   v a r i a b l e s  V = {v_i | i ∈ 
ω}, as well as  p r e d i c a t e   v a r i a b l e s  P = {p^k_i | i, k ∈ ω}.
          ┌
          │ By ω we understand the natural numbers including zero. All involved 
          │ symbols are pairwise disjoint. Therefore we can conclude for 
          │ example: f^k_i = f^(k')_(i') → (k = k’ ∧ i = i’) and h^k_i ≠ v_j.
          └
 For the  a r i t y  or  r a n k  of an operator we take the upper index. The 
set of predicate variables with zero arity is also called set of 
 p r o p o s i t i o n   v a r i a b l e s  or  s e n t e n c e   l e t t e r s 
: A := {p_i⁰ | i ∈ ω }. For subject variables we write short hand certain lower 
letters: v₁ = ‘u’, v₂ = ‘v’, v₃ = ‘w’, v₄ = ‘x’, v₅ = ‘y’, v₅ = ‘z’. Furthermore
we use the following short notations: for the predicate variables pⁿ₁ = ‘φ’ und 
pⁿ₂ = ‘ψ’, where the appropriate arity n is calculated by counting the 
subsequent parameters, for the proposition variables a₁ = ‘A’, a₂ = ‘B’ and a₃ =
C’, for the function variables: fⁿ₁ = ‘f’ und fⁿ₂ = ‘g’, where again the 
appropriate arity n is calculated by counting the subsequent parameters. All 
binary propositional operators are written in infix notation. Parentheses 
surrounding groups of operands and operators are necessary to indicate the 
intended order in which operations are to be performed. E. g. for the operator ∧
with the parameters A and B we write (A ∧ B). In the absence of parentheses the 
usual precedence rules determine the order of operations. Especially outermost 
parentheses are omitted. Also empty parentheses are stripped.

The operators have the order of precedence described below (starting with the 
highest). 
  ¬, ∀, ∃ 
 ∧ 
 ∨ 
 →, ↔ 



The term  t e r m  is defined recursively as follows:  
1. Every subject variable is a term. 
2. Let i, k ∈ ω and let t₁, ..., t_k be terms. Then h^k_i(t₁, ..., t_k) is a 
   term and if k > 0, so f^k_i(t₁, ..., t_k) is a term too. Therefore all zero 
   arity function constants {h⁰_i | i ∈ ω} are terms. They are called 
    i n d i v i d u a l   c o n s t a n t s .
          ┌
          │ In an analogous manner subject variables might be defined as 
          │ function variables of zero arity. Because subject variables play an 
          │ important role they have their own notation.
          └


We define a  f o r m u l a  and the relations  f r e e  and  b o u n d  subject 
variable recursivly as follows:  
1. Every proposition variable is a formula. Such formulas contain no free or 
   bound subject variables. 
2. If p^k is a predicate variable with arity k and c^k is a predicate constant 
   with arity k and t₁, t₂, ..., t_k are terms, then p^k(t₁, t₂, ... t_k) and 
   c^k(t₁, t₂, ..., t_k) are formulas. All subject variables that occur at least
   in one of t₁, t₂, ..., t_k are free subject variables. Bound subject 
   variables does not occur.
             ┌
             │ This second item includes the first one, which is only listed for
             │ clarity.
             └
 
3. Let α, β be formulas in which no subject variables occur bound in one formula
   and free in the other. Then ¬ α, (α ∧ β), (α ∨ β), (α → β) and (α ↔ β) are 
   also formulas. Subject variables which occur free (respectively bound) in α 
   or β stay free (respectively bound). 
4. If in the formula α the subject variable x₁ occurs not bound
             ┌
             │ This means that x₁ is free in the formula or does not occur at 
             │ all.
             └
   , then also ∀ x₁ α and ∃ x₁ α are formulas. The symbol ∀ is called 
    u n i v e r s a l   q u a n t i f i e r  and ∃ as  e x i s t e n t i a l  
    q u a n t i f i e r . Except for x₁ all free subject variables of α stay 
   free. All bound subject variables are still bound and additionally x₁ is 
   bound too. All formulas that are only built by usage of 1. and 3. are called 
   formulas of the  p r o p o s i t i o n a l   c a l c u l u s .

For each formula α the following proposition holds: the set of free subject 
variables is disjoint with the set of bound subject variables..
          ┌
          │ Other formalizations allow for example ∀ x₁ α also if x₁ occurs 
          │ already bound within α. Also propositions like α(x₁) ∧ (∀ x₁ β) are 
          │ allowed. In this formalizations free and bound are defined for a 
          │ single occurrence of a variable.
          └


If a formula has the form ∀ x₁   α respectively ∃ x₁   α then the formula α is 
called the  s c o p e  of the quantifier ∀ respectively ∃.

All formulas that are used to build up a formula by 1. to 4. are called  p a r t
 f o r m u l a s .

Chapter 2 


Axioms and Rules of Inference
═════════════════════════════

We now state the system of axioms for the propositional calculus and present the
rules for obtaining new formulas from them.


2.1 Axioms
――――――――――

We just list the axioms without further explanations.


☉ Axiom 1  (Implication Introduction)  [axiom:THEN-1]

     A → (B → A)


☉ Axiom 2  (Distribute Hypothesis over Implication)  [axiom:THEN-2]

     (A → (B → C)) → ((A → B) → (A → C))


☉ Axiom 3  (Eliminate Conjunction Right)  [axiom:AND-1]

     (A ∧ B) → A


☉ Axiom 4  (Eliminate Conjunction Left)  [axiom:AND-2]

     (A ∧ B) → B


☉ Axiom 5  (Conjunction Introduction)  [axiom:AND-3]

     B → (A → (A ∧ B))


☉ Axiom 6  (Disjunction Introduction Right)  [axiom:OR-1]

     A → (A ∨ B)


☉ Axiom 7  (Disjunction Introduction Left)  [axiom:OR-2]

     A → (B ∨ A)


☉ Axiom 8  (Disjunction Elimination)  [axiom:OR-3]

     (A → C) → ((B → C) → ((A ∨ B) → C))


☉ Axiom 9  (Negation Introduction)  [axiom:NOT-1]

     (A → B) → ((A → ¬ B) → ¬ A)


☉ Axiom 10  (Negation Elimination)  [axiom:NOT-2]

     ¬ A → (A → B)


☉ Axiom 11  (Excluded Middle)  [axiom:NOT-3]

     A ∨ ¬ A


☉ Axiom 12  (Equivalence Elimination right)  [axiom:IFF-1]

     (A ↔ B) → (A → B)


☉ Axiom 13  (Equivalence Elimination left)  [axiom:IFF-2]

     (A ↔ B) → (B → A)


☉ Axiom 14  (Equivalence Introduction)  [axiom:IFF-3]

     (A → B) → ((B → A) → (A ↔ B))


If something is true for all x, it is true for any specific y.

☉ Axiom 15  (Universal Instantiation)  [axiom:universalInstantiation]

     ∀ x φ(x) → φ(y)


If a predicate holds for some particular y, then there is an x for which the 
predicate holds.

☉ Axiom 16  (Existential Generalization)  [axiom:existencialGeneralization]

     φ(y) → ∃ x φ(x)



2.2 Rules of Inference
――――――――――――――――――――――

The following rules of inference enable us to obtain new true formulas from the 
axioms that are assumed to be true. From these new formulas we derive further 
formulas. So we can successively extend the set of true formulas.


☉ Rule 1  (Add true formula)  [rule:addProvenFormula]
  Name: Add  -  Version: 0.01.00

Addition of an axiom, definition or already proven formula. We have to reference
to the location of a true formula.


☉ Rule 2  (Modus Ponens)  [rule:modusPonens]
  Name: MP  -  Version: 0.01.00

If both formulas α and α → β are true, then we can conclude that β is true as 
well.


☉ Rule 3  (Replace Free Subject Variable)  [rule:replaceFree]
  Name: SubstFree  -  Version: 0.01.00

We start with a true formula. A free subject variable may be replaced by an 
arbitrary term, provided that the substituted term contains no subject variable 
that have a bound occurrence in the original formula. All occurrences of the 
free variable must be simultaneously replaced.

The prohibition to use subject variables within the term that occur bound in the
original formula has two reasons. First it ensures that the resulting formula is
well-formed. Secondly it preserves the validity of the formula. Let us look at 
the following derivation.

 ∀ x  ∃ y  φ(x, y)   →   ∃ y  φ(z,y)   with axiom 15 
 ∀ x  ∃ y  φ(x, y)   →   ∃ y  φ(y,y)   forbidden replacement: z in y, despite y 
is already bound 
 ∀ x  ∃ y  x ≠ y   →   ∃ y  y ≠ y   replace φ by ≠

This last proposition is not valid in many models.


☉ Rule 4  (Rename Bound Subject Variable)  [rule:renameBound]
  Name: Rename  -  Version: 0.01.00

We may replace a bound subject variable occurring in a formula by any other 
subject variable, provided that the new variable occurs not free in the original
formula. If the variable to be replaced occurs in more than one scope, then the 
replacement needs to be made in one scope only.


☉ Rule 5  (Replace Predicate Variable)  [rule:replacePred]
  Name: SubstPred  -  Version: 0.01.00

Let α be a true formula that contains a predicate variable p of arity n, let x₁,
..., x_n be pairwise different subject variables and let β(x₁, ..., x_n) be a 
formula where x₁, ..., x_n are not bound. The formula β(x₁, ..., x_n) must not 
contain all x₁, ..., x_n as free subject variables. Furthermore it can also have
other subject variables either free or bound. If the following conditions are 
fulfilled, then a replacement of all occurrences of p(t₁, ..., t_n) each with 
appropriate terms t₁, ..., t_n in α by β(t₁, ..., t_n) results in another true 
formula.  
1. the free variables of β(x₁, ..., x_n) without x₁, ..., x_n do not occur as 
   bound variables in α 
2. each occurrence of p(t₁, ..., t_n) in α contains no bound variable of β(x₁, 
   ..., x_n) 
3. the result of the substitution is a well-formed formula

See III § 5 in [hilback].

We can think in the same lines as by rule 3. The prohibition to use additional 
subject variables within the replacement formula that occur bound in the 
original formula assurs that the resulting formula is well-formed. Furthermore 
it preserves the validity of the formla. Take a look at the following 
derivation.

  φ(x)   →   ∃ y  φ(y)   with axiom 16 
  (∃ y  y = y) ∧ φ(x)   →   ∃ y  φ(y)   
  ∃ y  (y = y ∧ φ(x))   →   ∃ y  φ(y)   
  ∃ y  (y = y ∧ x ≠ y)   →   ∃ y  y ≠ y   forbidden replacment: φ(x) by x ≠ y, 
despite y is already bound 
  ∃ y   x ≠ y   →   ∃ y  y ≠ y  

The last proposition is not valid in many models.


Analogous to rule 5 we can replace function variables too.

☉ Rule 6  (Replace Function Variable)  [rule:replaceFunct]
  Name: SubstFun  -  Version: 0.01.00

Let α be an already proved formula that contains a function variable σ of arity 
n, let x₁, ..., x_n be pairwise different subject variables and let τ(x₁, ..., 
x_n) be an arbitrary term where x₁, ..., x_n are not bound. The term τ(x₁, ..., 
x_n) must not contain all x₁, ..., x_n as free subject variables. Furthermore it
can also have other subject variables either free or bound. If the following 
conditions are fulfilled we can obtain a new true formula by replacing each 
occurrence of σ(t₁, ..., t_n) with appropriate terms t₁, ..., t_n in α by τ(t₁, 
..., t_n).  
1. the free variables of τ(x₁, ..., x_n) without x₁, ..., x_n do not occur as 
   bound variables in α 
2. each occurrence of σ(t₁, ..., t_n) in α contains no bound variable of τ(x₁, 
   ..., x_n) 
3. the result of the substitution is a well-formed formula


☉ Rule 7  (Universal Generalization)  [rule:universalGeneralization]
  Name: Universal  -  Version: 0.01.00

If α → β(x₁) is a true formula and α does not contain the subject variable x₁, 
then α → (∀ x₁ (β(x₁))) is a true formula too.


☉ Rule 8  (Existential Generalization)  [rule:existentialGeneralization]
  Name: Existential  -  Version: 0.01.00

If α(x₁) → β is already proved to be true and β does not contain the subject 
variable x₁, then (∃ x₁ α(x₁)) → β is also a true formula.

q.e.d.



3.2 Deduction Theorem
―――――――――――――――――――――

We prove the deduction theorem. This leads to the new rule 
 C o n d i t i o n a l   P r o o f .


If we can prove B by assuming A as a hypothesis then we have proved A → B. This 
reasoning is justified by the so-called  d e d u c t i o n   t h e o r e m . The
deduction theorem holds for all first-order theories with the usual deductive 
systems for first-order logic. However our use of proposition variables and 
substitution rules make difficulties. We have to restrict the allowed inference 
rules to get a simular result.

☉ Rule 9   [rule:CP]
  Name: CP  -  Version: 0.02.00

We have the well-formed formula α and add it as a new proof line. Now we modify 
the existing inference rules. We can add a further proof line β if α → β is a 
well-formed formula and the usage of a previous inference rule with the 
following restrictions justifies the addition: for rule 3 occurs the replaced 
free variable not in α, for rule 5 occurs the replaced predicate variable not in
α, for rule 6 occurs the replaced function variable not in α.

Based on: 
 (axiom:THEN-1) (axiom:THEN-2)

The following rules have to be extended.

  Name: MP  -  Version: 0.02.00

See rule 9.

  Name: Add  -  Version: 0.02.00

See rule 9.

  Name: Rename  -  Version: 0.02.00

The deduction theorem enables us to prove propositions more easier in the next 
sections.



3.3 Propositions about implication
――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――――

We use rule 9 to derive more propositions containing only the implication 
operator.


☉ Proposition 5   [proposition:implication10]

     (A → (A → B)) → (A → B)

Proof (formal):
      Conditional Proof
  (1)   A → (A → B)                         Hypothesis
