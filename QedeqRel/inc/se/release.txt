This is an unstable development release of *Hilbert II*. 


This release contains a program suite that can produce LaTeX files
out of QEDEQ XML files. The QEDEQ files can be checked for 
syntactic correctness. 

Samples and a script with the beginning of axiomatic set theory
are included. All formulas are written in the formal language. 
Still no formal proofs are given. See  "Elements of Mathematical
Logic" for the logical background of this project (parts in 
German). 

Other samples show the error handling for incorrect QEDEQ files. 
Beside the XSD verification there are some semantical checks: 
"are all defined labels different" and "are all formulas well
formed"?

Formal proofs are not yet integrated.

Precondition to start the program is a Java Runtime Environment, at 
least version 1.4.

This release includes the source code and the JUnit test classes. 
The code coverage results of these tests where produced by Clover.
A library and necessary other libraries are also included.
