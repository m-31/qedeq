Version History

@QEDEQ_VERSION@
=======

Functional Changes
------------------  

  Extensions
  ----------
  * checking resolves external function and predicate constants; for
    example the predicate "equal" in QEDEQ module "qedeq_logic_v1.xml"
    is used within module "qedeq_set_theory_v1.xml" where it is
    referenced as "l.equal" where "l" is the import label for
    "qedeq_logic_v1.xml"
  * to resolve external references for the LaTeX generation the module 
    is checked. However if checking errors occur the generation of
    LaTeX is continued.
  * log4j watchdog: if trace configuration file changes, logging
    behaviour changes accordingly
  
  Fixed Bugs
  ----------
  * generation of LaTeX and checking of multiple QEDEQ modules doesn't
    stop if a selected module is not loaded

  Other Changes
  -------------
  * trace configuration now via log4j XML file and the default settings
    doesn't use XMLLayout any longer


XML Files
-----------

  Extensions
  ----------
  * "proplogic.xml" and "predlogic.xml" added because of external QEDEQ
    module resolution

  Fixed Bugs
  ----------
  none

  Other Changes
  -------------
  * "qedeq_basic_logic_v1.xml" is now more formal


Source Code
-----------

  Extensions
  ----------
  * if a predicate was already defined for an argument number the error
    message gives more information
  * an "ExistenceChecker" is now an attribute of ModuleProperties (if
    the QEDEQ module was successfully checked)
  * new classes "Predicate" and "Function" to describe keys for
    predicate and function constants
  
  Fixed Bugs
  ----------
  * trace methods have not only runtime object as parameter but also
    the calling class (needed because "this.getClass()" gives the the
    class of the runtime object; but we want to log the class the
    code resides in
  * for loading from QEDEQ home page: URL of "qedeq_sample1.xml" 
    corrected
  
  Other Changes
  -------------
  * the kernel (outside and inside) uses now a "ModuleAddress"
    instead of an QEDEQ module URL
  * "transverse" changed into "traverse"
  * "QedeqConfig" sets and gets file properties as files now
  * "TextInput" has no local address any longer
  * further work on Exception handling
