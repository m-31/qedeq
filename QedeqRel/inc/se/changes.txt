  * loading of required modules is now possible, for that reason
    there is a new state "DependencyState"
  * to make the kernel more independent of the save format details
    references to XML are isolated so
    - no XmlFileExceptionList exists any more
    - DefaultXmlFileExceptionList is now DefaultSourceFileExceptionList
    - SyntaxException is now XmlSyntaxException
  * global context is now an URL instead of String
  * SourceArea and SourcePosition have now no local reference any more
  * SourceFileException has the local file reference as parameter for
    "getDescription(URL)"
  * QEDEQ modules are identified by their URLs
  * SimpleXPath fulfills more tests
  
  Fixed Bugs
  ----------
  * log listeners can now be removed (so after a shutdown the old
    listeners can be removed)
