Version History

@QEDEQ_VERSION@
=======

Functional Changes
------------------  

  Extensions
  ----------
  * improved error descriptions if QEDEQ modules are imported
    recursivly
  * QEDEQ modules might be removed within the GUI, all dependent
    modules change their state accordingly
  * LaTeX parts support new command "\qref" to reference a
    Node from the local or an imported QEDEQ module
  
  Fixed Bugs
  ----------
  * encodings supported, UTF-8 and ISO-8859-1 are now correctly parsed
    and the error line has correctly translated

  Other Changes
  -------------
  * failure text area removed from state pane


XML Files
-----------

  Extensions
  ----------
  * a proposition more
  * more proofs

  Fixed Bugs
  ----------
  * qedeq_set_theory_v1.xml has now corrected references to 
    qedeq_logic_v1_en.pdf; one formula was corrected
  * predlogic.xml has now a correct LaTeX pattern for predicate "equal"

  Other Changes
  -------------
  none


Source Code
-----------

  Extensions
  ----------
  * new "XmlModuleLoader" implementing new interface ModuleLoader, thus
    loading and parsing a physical QEDEQ file is separated
  * kernel has new method for getting a String error description for
    all errors
  * uses class "com.sun.syndication.io.XmlReader" from project Rome
    (see https://rome.dev.java.net/source/browse/rome/src/java/)
    to get an java.io.Reader from an XML file, this reader is
    responsible to get the correct encoding
  * new class "ControlVisitor" that is an "AbstractModuleVisitor" that
    gives some error collecting features and hides the traverser;
    this simplifies some checkers (e.g. 
    "QedeqBoDuplicateLanguageChecker")
  * "LoadRequiredModules" uses new class "LoadDirectlyRequiredModules";
    they check for recursive imports, now there is no need to catch
    an OutOfMemoryError any longer; also all existing tests now
    run green
  * "KernelContext" implements now the three interfaces
    "KernelProperties", "KernelState", "KernelServices"
  * "SourceFileException" doesn't parse the source file itself to get
    the error line but the "ModuleLoader" can do that
  * IoUtility has now methods that deal with encodings
  * XPathLocationParser now uses new XmlReader to get exact location
  * new "StateManager" that manages state change for a "KernelQedeqBo"
    so that changing the loading, dependency or checking state of a
    QEDEQ module changes the state of depending modules accordingly
  * KernelQedeqBo throws an Error if validation of dependencies failed
  * new loading state "LoadingState.STATE_DELETED" for deleted modules
  * Qedeq2Latex

  Fixed Bugs
  ----------
  * "ModuleEventListenerLog.stateChanged" decides now correctly if
    it is a failure or not
  * "ParserHandler.startElement" now really throws the
    "XmlSyntaxException"

  Other Changes
  -------------
  * GUI uses now new kernel method for checking a QEDEQ module instead
    of doing it itself
  * "ModuleProperties" and "QedeqBo" married, family name is "QedeqBo";
    the kernel internal "QedeqBo" is called "KernelQedeqBo"; this
    "KernelQedeqBo" does call "ModuleEventLog.getInstance()
    .stateChanged(this)"; new protected methods for setting elementary
    properities added, these are used by the "StateManager" and
    "XmlModuleLoader" for example
  * "DefaultModuleFactory" -> "DefaultInternalKernelServices"
  * "DefaultModuleReferenceList" -> "KernelModuleReferenceList"
  * "ModuleNodes" -> "ModuleLables"
  * "StringUtility" (previously "ReplaceUtility") has some methods from
    "IoUtility"
  * "KernelServices.removeModule(ModuleAddress)" throws no longer an
    "IOException"
  * attribute address removed from "TextInput"
  * "Term.getQedeqXml" doesn't log a fatal exception for variables or
    constants if they have arguments
