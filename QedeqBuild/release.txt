This is an unstable development release of *Hilbert II*. 


This release contains a program suite that can produce LaTeX files
out of QEDEQ XML files. The QEDEQ files can be checked for 
syntactic correctness. 

Samples and a script with the beginning of axiomatic set theory
"qedeq_set_theory_v1.pdf" are included. The logical background of
this project is described in "qedeq_logic_v1.pdf". Both documents
were generated with the progam suite. All formulas of axioms,
definitions and propositions are written in a formal language. 
Included are also samples showing the error handling for incorrect
QEDEQ files. Beside the XSD verification there are some semantic
checks: "are all defined labels different" and "are all formulas
well formed"?

Formal proofs and their verification are not yet integrated in the
program suite. At least "set_theory_v1" contains some informal
proofs that can be easily transformed into formal ones.

This is still called a "mongaga" release however all points of
"gaffsie" are already fulfilled.

Precondition to start the program is a Java Runtime Environment, at
least version 1.4.2

The "dev" releases include also the source code, JUnit test classes,
and various code metric results.

PLEASE NOTE: the tar.bz2 archives can only be untarred with GNU tar.
The "win" and "unx" releases differ only in the carriage return
character for text files.
