Making a release for *Hilbert II*


Prepare for Build
-----------------
- check eclipse "problems"
- check eclipse "task list"
- run Classcycle / look at 
  http://meyling.de:8080/hudson/job/QedeqReleaseBuild/ws/qedeq_gen/release/ant/modules/qedeq_kernel/target/reports/jdepend/report/jdepend-report.html#NVcycles
- run FindBugs   / look at http://meyling.de:8080/hudson/job/QedeqReleaseBuild/364/findbugsResult/
- run *PestSuite s and change all running tests from "pest*" into "test*"
- run fastBuild


Preliminary Build
-----------------
- test within eclipse if QedeqMainFrame works ok  (open all windows!)
- run QedeqBuild/scripts/fastCloverBuild to create new development release
  + look at the messages during build project (e.g. javadoc warnings)
  + if it runs through all tests are ok
  + direct execution, is all still working (open all windows!)
  + look into the generated pdfs if they look ok
  + check java doc
    > is every package there
    > look at the messages during build project
  + examine index.html and update it
  + transfer release to WebPage
    [ now done by build script: ]
    > copy xml-apis.jar and xercesImpl.jar from eclipse/webstart
      directory into release webstart directory (they are stripped
      of the original manifest.mf and are signed with jarsigner due 
      to an java webstart bug)
    > web execution, is that ok too?
    > inside FireFox run checky to validate the HTML
