This open source project wants to present mathematical knowledge in a formal correct form.
This is only an unstable development release of <b>Hilbert&nbsp;II</b>. It can produce LaTeX files out of QEDEQ XML files.
</p>

<p>
The goal of <b>Hilbert&nbsp;II</b> is decentralised access to verified and readable mathematical knowledge.
The knowledge base contains mathematical texts in different languages and detail levels, axioms, definitions, propositions and their proofs. Beside common non formal proofs the system includes formal proofs that were verified by a proof checker.
</p>

<p>
The mathematical axioms, definitions and propositions are combined to so called QEDEQ modules. Such a module could be seen as a mathematical textbook. At least all proposition formulas are written in a formal language and each proposition can also have a formal correct proof. The proposition is verified iff it has a formal proof and all required propositions are also verified.
</p>

<p>
<b>Hilbert&nbsp;II</b> will provide a program suite that enables a mathematician to put data into that knowledge base and retrieve various documents and analyze results out of the system. This includes the generation of LaTeX files that look like a common mathematical textbook and the answer to questions like &quot;assumes this theorem the axiom of choice?&quot; for verified propositions. As it's name already suggests, this project is in the tradition of <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hilbert-program/">Hilbert's program</a>.
</p>

<p>
Because this system is not centrally administrated and references to any location in the internet are possible, a world wide mathematical knowledge base could be build. Any proof of a theorem in this &quot;mathematical web&quot; could be drilled down to the very elementary rules and axioms. Think of an incredible number of mathematical textbooks with hyperlinks and each of its proofs could be verified by <b>Hilbert&nbsp;II</b>. For each theorem the dependency of other theorems, definitions and axioms could be easily derived.
