Version History

@QEDEQ_VERSION@
=======

Functional Changes
------------------  

  Extensions
  ----------
  - we use now animated icons for progress visualization and colors for status information
      gray   = starting loading process
      violet = loaded
      cyan   = loaded imports
      orange = well formed
      yellow = fully formally proved
    errors and warning decorations give additional information
  - process view:
    + shows initially only running service processes - with a toggle button you can also view the
      last (= currently all) finished ones
    + multiple selections (enables selecting all and stopping all processes)
    + new "Details" button shows detailed information about selected processes and their
      plugin calls

  Fixed Bugs
  ----------
  - bug fix: for qedeq_error_sample04.xml we can now generate UTF-8 and LaTeX files
