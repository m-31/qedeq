@QEDEQ_VERSION@
=======

Functional Changes
------------------  

  Extensions
  ----------
  - conditional formal proof method supported, this means we can add a
    hypothesis, draw proof lines and a conclusion (hypothesis implies
    last proof line); see "doc/math/qedeq_propositional_v1.xml"
  
  Fixed Bugs
  ----------
  none 

  Other Changes

Source Code
-----------

  Extensions
  ----------
  - added ConditionalProof that is an extension of FormalProofLine and of
    reason; also Hypothesis and Conclusion were added in this context
  - new implementation of ProofChecker that supports ConditionalProof
    


  Fixed Bugs
  ----------
  - 


  Other Changes
  -------------
  - removed interface ReasonType and all implementations, now every
    Reason implementation has an identifying method e.g.
    ModusPonens.getModusPonens;
  - IoUtility.toUrl calls getAbsoluteFile to get rid of relative path
    elements
  - LogicalCheckExceptionList has now a add(LogicalCheckExceptionList)
    method
  - ReferenceResolver has more methods

    contains a hypothesis, proof lines and a conclusion
