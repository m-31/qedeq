=======

Functional Changes
------------------  

  Extensions
  ----------
  - now we have plugins: that are GUI callable actions that do something
    with a QEDEQ module. As there are: "Show module as UTF-8 text",
    "Create LaTeX" (old feature), "Create UTF-8", and "Model Tester".
    The first ones are self-explanatory. The last one enables us to test
    the validity of formulas in different finite models. The "four
    element model" is our approved model. It contains the following four
    elements: {}, {{}}, {{}, {{}}} and {{{}}}. Together with the usual
    "element of" relation we can fulfill almost all formulas of our
    logic and set theory script. 
  - Because the model tester costs some time we now have a process
    overview window. In this window all plugin processes and their
    status is shown. It is also possible to interrupt running processes.
  - the plugin results (usually warnings) can be deleted completely.
    So we can keep an overview even if we change the model.
  - all plugins are configurable via a GUI dialog
  - the error and warnings list pane has now a context menu to export
    results into the clipboard
  - the status pane has now a field that shows the number of errors and
    warnings
  - help system can now link to external pages via external browser
    call
  - 

  Fixed Bugs
  ----------
  - checker for logical correctness didn't notice incorrect definitions
    Now we check, that definitions contain only subject variables within
    VARLIST and test that these subject variables are free in the
    defining term or formula. We also verify there are no other subject
    variables free

  Other Changes
  -------------
  - improved speed, after establishing a global "trace of" switch which
    can disable tracing completely (without testing for log levels)
  - we now have GUI configurable icon sizes and "look and feel" 
  - some icons changed
  - a little bit more mouse over effects


XML Files
-----------

  Extensions
  ----------
  math\qedeq_sample2.xml

  Fixed Bugs
  ----------
  math\qedeq_logic_v1.xml
  - spelling errors corrected
  - some \ref s were replaced by \qref s
  - formal definitions for implication, conjunction and equivalence
    were transformed into subsections. Our model tester correctly
    bitched about it.
  - formal definition of restricted quantifiers were also transformed.
    This time into axioms with a "definedOperator" attribute.
  - within "theorem:predicateCalculus" two equivalences were only
    implications. Thanks again to our model tester for finding these
    errors.

  math\set_theory_v1.xml

  Other Changes
  -------------
  change to UTF-8


Source Code
-----------

  Extensions
  ----------
  - new class AbstractOutput (for StringOutput and TextOutput)
  - new class SubTextInput (as a wrapper for TextOutput)
  - TextOutput has new constructor with parameter char encoding
  - TextInput has some more methods and the performance of 
    setPosition was improved
  - SourceArea has also a short description method
  - Trace has now a new global flag: traceOn  if this is true we
    don't check any trace levels. This is much much faster than
    doing it with Commons Logging and Log4J.
  - DateUtility has some more methods for getting time strings
  - Enumerator can now be reset to zero
  - new class Splitter for splitting strings into string separated
    pieces
  - StringUtility has new methods for presenting a Map or Set and
    for formatting
  - new class TextPaneWindow for displaying text information
  - ControlVisitor contains now QedeqNumbers, so every plugin can
    that numbers
  - StateManger returns only lists instead of null if no errors
    or warnings occurred
  - DefaultModuleAddress has now a default dummy constructor. It is
    only used in tests or not referenced classes
  - ConfigAccess has new methods to get Map of properties with
    certain given prefix. This is used for plugin configuration.
  - Qedeq2Xml writes now UTF-8 as charset
  - Xml2Xml uses now UTF-8 output
  - XmlQedeqFileDao.createSourceArea returns never null
    
  

  Fixed Bugs
  ----------
  - SourceFileException uses now Plugin information for equals and
    hashCode
  - XPathLocationParser.findSourceArea catches now RuntimeExceptions
  

  Other Changes
  -------------
  - we now have a JUnit test that checks if every class has a test
    class in the packages (QedeqBase, Qedeq
  - we updated the tango icons, integrated eclipse icons and of the 
    Open Icon Library (http://openiconlibrary.sourceforge.net) in
    different sizes
  - start slow tests is now controlled by system property


XSD
---

  Extensions
  ----------
  - AXIOM has now new string attribute "definedOperator". The value
    can contain an operator which is defined by the axiom. This axiom
    and the operator could be eliminated by replacing the operator with
    the right part of the axiom. Example: definition of restricted
    quantifiers.
