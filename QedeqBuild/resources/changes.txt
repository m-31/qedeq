Version History

@QEDEQ_VERSION@
=======

Functional Changes
------------------  

  Extensions
  ----------
  - You can write formal proofs that use only the basic rules. These proofs
    can be seen in the text viewer and the generated LaTeX sources. They are
    still not checked for correctness.
    For an example see "sample\qedeq_sample3.xml" 
  
  Fixed Bugs
  ----------
  - 

  Other Changes

XML Files
-----------

  Extensions
  ----------
  math\qedeq_logic_v1.xml and math\qedeq_set_theory_v1.xml
  - further integration of Amrum notes (and some other) (made possible by
    the Ramada Cup in Hamburg Bergedorf ;-)
  
  project\qedeq_logic_language.xml
  - now with listing of basic formal proof rules

  sample\qedeq_sample3.xml
  - this file was added to demonstrate the new syntax for basic formal proofs

  Fixed Bugs
  ----------
  math\qedeq_logic_v1.xml
  -

  math\qedeq_set_theory_v1.xml
  - theorem:powerProposition isSet(x) changed to isSet(x)

  Other Changes
  -------------
  - rename of error sample XML files
  - label naming convention changed: labels are now parsed by
    ControlVisitor and have the following syntax:
    label reference                   importLabel
    (external) node reference         [importLabel].nodeLabel
    (external) node sub formula ref.  [[importLabel].nodeLabel/]subFormula
    (external) node proof line ref.   [[importLabel].nodeLabel!]lineLabel

Source Code
-----------

  Extensions
  ----------
  - DynamicDirectInterpreter uses now Latex2Utf8Parser to produce readable
    debug output
  - new constructor for dummy areas for SourceArea
  - various classes in different tiers for proof reason integration
  - Qedeq2Xml escapes XML entities now
  

  Fixed Bugs
  ----------
  - removed # in userinterface.html
  - loading from local file failed is now correctly noted
  - definedOperator is now set within QedeqVoBuilder
  

  Other Changes
  -------------
  - InternalKernelServices (and implementations) must now provide an error
    code and text when creating errors
  - refactoring of error code and warnings: name convention implemented
  - FormulaChecker renamed into FormulaCheckerImpl and now we use a factory
    to produce instances of the new interface FormulaChecker, some methods
    are now in the new class FormulaUtility
  - KernelServices run now with QedeqBoFormalLogicCheckerPlugin which is
    more like a real plugin now
  - KernelServices (and implementations) loadModule and loadRequredModule
    doesn't throw a SourceFileExceptionList any longer
  - DefaultKernelQedeqBo's existence checker is now also set if logical
    check fails
  - refactoring of QedeqKernelSe: "se" package name inserted
  - SaxDefaultHandler accepts now only 20 XML errors and ignores the rest
  - copy QedeqKernelBoTest test data also to QedeqKernelXmlTest during build
  - TextPaneWindow uses now font "Monospaced"
  - StringUtility has new method to get a substring
