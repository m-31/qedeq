Version History

@QEDEQ_VERSION@
=======

Functional Changes
------------------  

  Extensions
  ----------
  - conditional formal proof method supported, this means we can add a
    hypothesis, draw proof lines and a conclusion (hypothesis implies
    last proof line);
    one can check if the rule is correctly used with the proof checker;
    see "doc/math/qedeq_formal_logic_v1.xml"
  - proof finder can now be fine tuned in plugin preferences dialog; you
    can define the order of rule usage and the number of proof lines the
    rule is used before changing to the next rule
   

  Fixed Bugs
  ----------
  - don't save formal proofs twice any longer

  Other Changes
  -------------
  - we classified the rule versions for modules in the following manner:
    + 0.00.00 herein are no formal proofs supported
    + 0.01.00 only basic proof methods can be used
    + 0.02.00 we have the modified basic rules plus conditional proof
    + 1.00.00 these rules we need to check "qedeq_set_theory_v1.xml",
              not yet defined
  - logging output was simplified, messages for the same module are
    aggregated
  - proof finder and model tester write now logging messages 


XML Files
-----------

  Extensions
  ----------
  - In "doc/math/qedeq_formal_logic_v1.xml" we develop our formal logic.
    It includes the axioms and rules of predicate calculus and contains
    only propositions that have formal proofs.

  Fixed Bugs
  ----------
  - some minor corrections

  Other Changes
  -------------
  - renamed "doc/math/qedeq_propositional_v1.xml" into
    "doc/math/qedeq_formal_logic_v1.xml"


Source Code
-----------

  Extensions
  ----------
  - added ConditionalProof that is an extension of FormalProofLine and of
    reason; also Hypothesis and Conclusion were added in this context
  - new implementation of ProofChecker that supports ConditionalProof


  Fixed Bugs
  ----------
  - we got rid of package cycles again


  Other Changes
  -------------
  - removed interface ReasonType and all implementations, now every
    Reason implementation has an identifying method e.g.
    ModusPonens.getModusPonens;
  - IoUtility.toUrl calls getAbsoluteFile to get rid of relative path
    elements
  - LogicalCheckExceptionList has now a add(LogicalCheckExceptionList)
    method
  - ReferenceResolver has more methods

  Extensions
  ----------
  - we now support a "CP" element; that is a conditional proof that
    contains a hypothesis, proof lines and a conclusion

  Fixed Bugs
  ----------
  none

  Other Changes
  -------------
  none
