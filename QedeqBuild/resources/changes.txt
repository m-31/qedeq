Version History

@QEDEQ_VERSION@
=======

Functional Changes
------------------  

  Extensions
  ----------
  - now we have plugins: that are GUI callable actions that do something
    with a QEDEQ module. As there are: "Show module as UTF-8 text",
    "Create LaTeX" (old feature), "Create UTF-8", and "Model Tester".
    The first ones are self-explanatory. The last one enables us to test
    the validity of formulas in different finite models. The "four
    element model" is our approved model. It contains the following four
    elements: {}, {{}}, {{}, {{}}} and {{{}}}. Together with the usual
    "element of" relation we can fulfill almost all formulas of our
    logic and set theory script. 
  - Because the model tester costs some time we now have a process
    overview window. In this window all plugin processes and their
    status is shown. It is also possible to interrupt running processes.
  - the plugin results (usually warnings) can be deleted completely.
    So we can keep an overview even if we change the model.
  - all plugins are configurable via a GUI dialog
  - the error and warnings list pane has now a context menu to export
    results into the clipboard
  - the status pane has now a field that shows the number of errors and
    warnings
  - help system can now link to external pages via external browser
    call

  Fixed Bugs
  ----------
  - 

  Other Changes
  -------------
  - improved speed, after establishing a global "trace of" switch which
    can disable tracing completely (without testing for log levels)
  - we now have GUI configurable icon sizes and "look and feel" 
  - some icons changed
  - a little bit more mouse over effects

Source Code
-----------

  Extensions
  ----------
  - new class AbstractOutput (for StringOutput and TextOutput)
  - new class SubTextInput (as a wrapper for TextOutput)
  - TextOutput has new constructor with parameter char encoding
  - TextInput has some more methods and the performance of 
    setPosition was improved
  - SourceArea has also a short description method
  - Trace has now a new global flag: traceOn  if this is true we
    don't check any trace levels. This is much much faster than
    doing it with Commons Logging and Log4J.
  - DateUtility has some more methods for getting time strings
  - Enumerator can now be reset to zero
  - new class Splitter for splitting strings into string separated
    pieces
  - StringUtility has new methods for presenting a Map or Set and
    for formatting
  - new class TextPaneWindow for displaying text information
  - ControlVisitor contains now QedeqNumbers, so every plugin can
    that numbers

  - we updated the tango icons, integrated eclipse icons and of the 
    Open Icon Library (http://openiconlibrary.sourceforge.net) in
    different sizes
