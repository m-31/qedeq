Version History

@QEDEQ_VERSION@
=======

Functional Changes
------------------

  Extensions
  ----------
  - we use now animated icons for progress visualization and colors for status information
      gray   = starting loading process
      violet = loaded
      cyan   = loaded imports
      orange = well formed
      yellow = fully formally proved
    errors and warning decorations give additional information
  - process view:
    + shows initially only running service processes - with a toggle button you can also view the
      last (= currently all) finished ones
    + multiple selections (enables selecting all and stopping all processes)
    + new "Details" button shows detailed information about selected processes and their
      plugin calls
    + (more) internal processes are now also visible and interruptable

  Fixed Bugs
  ----------
  - bug fix: for qedeq_error_sample04.xml we can now generate UTF-8 and LaTeX files
  - plugin view shows now correct termination status
  - now also very long tool tips should be readable; also html entities are handled correctly
  - refresh of process view should work properly now


  Other Changes
  -------------
  - initial dimensions of start window increased 
  - status display of QEDEQ module via colors: all icons changed
  - log4j configuration file is now marked and treated as UTF-8
  - find proofs stops now if no new proof lines can be generated

Source Code

  Extensions
  ----------
  - new class ModuleArbiter for organizing the QEDEQ module access
  - for whole QEDEQ module locking process a huge refactoring takes place; it is still not finished
  - GuiHelper.getToolTipText: get tool tip text as html
  - GuiHelper provides now a generic image icon
  - plugins can have process individual parameters
  - check for correct proofs is now integrated into kernel, so we have a new explicit action:
    CheckFormallyProvedAction
  - QedeqLog can deal now with null LogListener s
  - ControlVisitor has now a test mode so we could remove the doubled class in the test project

  Fixed Bugs
  ----------
  - FormulaUtility uses now EqualsUtility for checking operator equality

  Other Changes
  -------------
  - we have now the following InternalPlugin s: LoadDirectlyRequiredModulesPlugin
    LoadAllRequiredModulesPlugin, LoadRequiredModulesPlugin, WellFormedCheckerPlugin,
    FormalProofCheckerPlugin; these plugin are now fully integrated in the kernel and their progress
    is visible in processes now; they are also interruptable
  - for animated icons we use: http://sourceforge.net/projects/furbelow/
  - small bug fixes because of new findbugs version
  - maven POM uses now same java help version (we found it in maven repository)
    also java source and java doc files are generated now and we provide a code coverage report
    by emma
  - Main loads log4j file now as UTF-8
  - clover coverage reports are generated by a new clover version
  - InternalKernelServices extends only KernelProperties now; KernelServices are not included!
    so plugins should only use the InternalKernelServices; some methods have also changed
    their location from KernelServices to InternalKernelServices
