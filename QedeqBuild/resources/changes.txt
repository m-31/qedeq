Version History

@QEDEQ_VERSION@
=======

Functional Changes
------------------  

  Extensions
  ----------
  - we have now a parser that can read a propositional calculus proof
    written in ASCII text format and transform it into a QEDEQ XML NODE
    element. It was quickly hacked together but enables us to speed up
    proof integration. Later on we should have a syntax description for
    the text format, support for other proof rules and a better error
    handling. It can be accessed via GUI menu entry
     Tools / Proof Text to QEDEQ
  - a rule has now a version too
  - check definition of rule version before using it
  - introducing and using "brief" parameter for LaTeX and UTF-8 plugin
  - print rule name and rule version in LaTeX and UTF-8 plugin
  - rules can change previous rules, so a rule can have a list of
    rules that are affected
  - links to rule definition are included in LaTeX plugin output
    for rule usages

  - some context setting errors resolved
