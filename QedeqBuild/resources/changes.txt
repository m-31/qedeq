Version History

@QEDEQ_VERSION@
=======

Functional Changes
------------------  

  Extensions
  ----------
  - now the first pages of a new online help are working
  - new about dialog with system properties that can be copied into clipboard
  - warnings are now supported: LaTeX generation problems lead to warnings that
    also can be clicked
  
  Fixed Bugs
  ----------
  - within the buffer directory only all *.xml files are deleted when
    the buffer is cleaned; so we have no problem with the lock file

  Other Changes
  -------------
  - generate LaTeX output for modules with extra printed (\tt) QEDEQ reference
    in clear text. So module authors can easily reference to that node. In some
    future releases this option should be editable in the LaTeX plugin
    preferences page.
