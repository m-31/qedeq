Version History

@QEDEQ_VERSION@
=======

Functional Changes
------------------  

  Extensions
  ----------
  - we have now a parser that can read a propositional calculus proof
    written in ASCII text format and transform it into a QEDEQ XML NODE
    element. It was quickly hacked together but enables us to speed up
    proof integration. Later on we should have a syntax description for
    the text format, support for other proof rules and a better error
    handling. It can be accessed via GUI menu entry
     Tools / Proof Text to QEDEQ
  - a rule has now a version too and name plus version must be unique,
    also some new checks tests if the version numbers are correct
  - check definition of rule version before using it
  - introducing and using "brief" parameter for LaTeX and UTF-8 plugin
  - print rule name and rule version in LaTeX and UTF-8 plugin
  - rules can change previous rules, so a rule can have a list of
    rules that are affected
  - links to rule definition are included in LaTeX plugin output
    for rule usages
  - rule names now harmonized throughout the application

  Fixed Bugs
  ----------
  - proof line links within PDF document is working again
  - proofs for rules are not double any more
  - some context setting errors resolved
  - now we can produce UTF-8 text files without automatic line breaking
    again

  Other Changes
  -------------
  - we now use package hyperref for links
  - version number checks included
  - link to external QEDEQ modules get now correct language PDF


XML Files
-----------

  Extensions
  ----------
  - added proposition with proof for (-B -> -A) -> (A -> B)
  - some more propositions proved also the associative laws
    for conjunction and disjunction
  

  Fixed Bugs
  ----------
  - none

  Other Changes
  -------------
  - title change
  - reorganization of content
  - rule version integration, rule name harmonization
    SET_DEFINION_BY_FORMULA -> CLASS_DEFINITION_BY_FORMULA


Source Code
-----------

  Extensions
  ----------
  - TextInput has new methods: skipToEndOfLine,
    readStringTilWhitespace, readNonNegativeInt
  - new classes Version and VersionSet for version numbering according
    to the standard in http://semver.org  this format is also checked
    when running WellFormedCheckerPlugin
  - ProofParserPane (and further classes) added for text proof parser
  - StringUtility has new method: isIn
  - integrated new RuleExistenceChecker
  - new classes RuleKey, ChangedRule and ChangedRuleList (for changes
    done by a new rule to existing rules) and further classes
    integrated
 
  Fixed Bugs
  ----------
  - ParserPane shows now (more) correct error position
  - QedeqKernelBo isSupportedLanguage works now
  - some characters of axiomatic_set_theory.txt corrected
  - Qedeq2Utf8Executor supports now a maximum column length of 0
    (no automatic line breaking) again
  

  Other Changes
  -------------
  - the build script includes now QedeqBoTest classes before QedeqBo
    classes in class path because we replace ControlVisitor with an
    another method implementation of setLocationWithinModule that
    checks for object existence of the given context - so now every
    context set within a JUnit test is checked for existence!
  - DefaultModuleAddress returns now "file://" instead of "file:"
    this seems to be something in the the URL constructor ...
    as a result the file links in PDF files should work now
